            <h1>What are cookies?</h1>
            <article>The cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that will be stored on a userâ€™s computer, mobile terminal or other equipment from which the Internet is accessed without allowing it to be personally identified.<br>
                The cookie is installed through the request issued by the userâ€™s terminal to a vying.io server or to a third-party server.</article>
            <h1>What kind of cookies do we use?</h1>
            <article>Only one cookie per session that allows us to show you the cookie banner. For now. <br>If we will add some more we will keep you up to date.<br>
                The cookies per session are temporary files that remain in the userâ€™s terminal until the end of the session (or maximum one day) or until the browser is closed.<br>
                Why don't we use more cookies?<br>
                Well, because we do not have time to use the infos that cookies can deliver.And because we do not provide a login option yet.Also, because GDPR got so complicated, we prefer not to set them just to have cookies.
